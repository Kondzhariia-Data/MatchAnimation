# MatchAnimation

## General:

In this example, I want to share the implementation of the **Match** animation using the `Hero` pod.
In almost every application, we have similar screens with a list of *Items*, and when you click on a specific *Item* it opens a screen with detailed information.
So, this is an example of how you can diversify your application with such animation instead of standard transitions between screens.

`http://api.tvmaze.com/` is the **API** I used in this project.
